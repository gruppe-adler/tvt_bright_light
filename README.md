# Search & Rescue in Cam Lao Nam

# Scenario
A spike team was shot down in the middle of enemy territory. Unsurprisingly, the enemy noticed the crash and is closing in. Rumours among GIs say that Dac Cong commando units operate in this AO - special forces trained to hunt down and kill spike teams. Meanwhile, the spike teams distress call was received on the far island of Dharma and preparation are already underway to get the boys out.

# Gameplay
The players are separated into three factions:

## The Spike Team (Independent):

- Starts at a randomly selected crash site
- Main goal is to be rescued by the search team and evade getting killed by the dac-cong commando team
- Has no tracer bullets or smoke grenades , but can create a smoking fire (ACE self-interaction)
- When detected by the opfor KI for more than ~30 seconds, the KI will inform the dac-cong commando team about the approximate location of the spike team
- The explosive specialist of the spike team carries 2 APERS mines
- The spike team will create track markers every now and then which can be found by the search team, but also by the dac cong commandos. [N] tracks cannot be seen while in vehicles!
